# Revise Maths
This maths game is designed as a fun and engaging way of helping young kids study and get better at mental arithmetic. This game was created purely for educational purposes. 

# Business/Social Goals
- Create a fun and engaging platform for young kids to learn arithmetic and help them develop an interest in mathematics and logical thinking. 
- Add a competitive edge to the game by using a timer for each arithmetic session - this will allow the user to either compete against peers or themselves in the amount of questions they answer correctly within a set timeframe. 
- Create an intuitive interface for young users to increase comfort with using the program, and encourage them to use it repeatedly - drive traffic onto the website. 
- Encourage the idea that games can be used as an additional tool in learning, and not as a form of distraction.
- Allow users to take their time revising any errors in their own time following each timed arithmetic session.

# UX Goals
- Create a simple and intuitive user interface for young and first time users to foster a sense of comfort and reassurance. 
- To allow the user as much control over their learning enviornments as possible and appropriate - ensure they can pick what kind of arithmetic they want (addition&subtraction, multiplication, division, or random), include 'Skip' and 'Exit' buttons for each session in case the user becomes overwhelmed.
- Add a filtering system for the incorrectly answered questions if user is using the 'random' category, and colour differentiate to mark the different categories in the tabs side of the revision panel. 
- Make sure the UI maintains its focus on content by excluding all unnecessary information. 
- Where colours are used, they are to be used for the purpose of highlighting or differentiating one element from another.

# Scope of Application

The scope of this application is as follows: 
1. This is a front end application, created to help young users with mental arithmetic and logical thinking. 
2. A heading with the name of the application and a short description on the first 'login' page. Wording is kept to the bare minimum after this to ensure attention is directed towards necessary fields only - the game field, and later the revision field. 
3. Category selection - so users can pick the type of arithmetic they would like to practice. This works as a type of difficulty selection. 
4. The game field contains a small introduction with the user's name and the task they are to solve. 
5. 'Submit' and 'Skip' buttons below the field. Additional logic is implemented to handle 'Enter' keypress instead of 'Submit'. 'Skip' skips one question. 
6. Score tracking for answered questions. 
7. A revision field for incorrectly answered questions. Tabs at the edge of this field record the incorrectly answered questions for revision later. 
8. 'Exit' button to end the session. 
9. Footer containing copyright, t&c, and links to social platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram). 

# Strategy
It is the goal of this application to create a dynamic, intuitive, and simple interface to help young users study, improve and speed up their mental arithmetic and logical thinking. To design the application, aspects like target audience, key information deliverables, visual simplicity, and data transfer were key considerations: 

## Target Audience
- Young users (6 - 12 yrs)

## Key Information Deliverables
- Category Selection
- Game field with relevant information
- Visual score tracking 
- Revision Field with tabs

## Visual Simplicity
- Minimise distraction by avoiding images and icons within the main fields, but use colours to engage young users and emphasise information containers and user interactions where appropriate. 
- White Space in main fields (gaming and revision) to minimise distraction of cintent around + 'clear' space for thinking + place emphasis on task inside these fields. 
- Minimum and concise wording - Clear headings, short description + greeting, recognisable, one-word buttons describing purpose (with caution of avoiding 'Quit' on the exit button to avoid negative conotation). 
- Visual score tracking system using red for wrong answers and green for correct answers + large numbers for amount of wrong/right answers recorded. 
- Recognisable tab system (often used in school folders) for recording incorrect answers for easy recognition. 

This application is intended to be used primarily on laptop, but actively considers visual appeal and usability on phones through media queries and content placement/spacing.
